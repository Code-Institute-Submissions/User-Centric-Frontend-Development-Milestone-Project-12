# Halveksia Band Page - Jai Austin
User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This sites aim is to promote the band Halveksia and promote the upcoming shows, while also giving an informative look at each band member and the genral direction of the band.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://jai-austin95.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/).


## UX
With the design of the site I aimed towards a dark tone, white and black sleek design with some grey put in for features. As the band and its potential users will more or less be attracted to the darker portrayal of the band.
The layout is smooth and easily operable, straight forward and clear. 


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. javascript

## Features
The site has a fixed nav bar for ease of access to all parts of the page, with the logo acting as a return to top. the nav bar is also collapsable.


## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.


## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can `git clone` the code to run it locally on your machine.

### Content
I've written the basic structure and design of the entire website by myself, the site is laid out as a single page scroll down, with each section in its own sectoin. I have used some template code in my nav bar for the collapsable menu from w3schools for the Jave script as as far as my course has taken me we have not used java script hyet and this was a feature i wanted to include in my project.

### Media 
All photo media was given full permission by the band to use in this project, I was givin permission to upload them to an Imgur account in order to link them to the web page. Photos are not publicly released on imgur.
