			<h2> About The Band</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Halveksia is a Brighton based gothic metal band comprised of 5 members, formed in 2018 they have written
				all their own original songs and are set to preform their debut show in the new year of 2020! Taking
				infulences from bands such as Paradise Lost, Potion, Sentenced as well as a mixture of great rock
				legends infused with the melodic nature of 80's pop music. We look forward to bringing you our own
				"Chuggy style" and hope you all stick around while we grow!

			<hr>
			<p>Jack Mayhew the lead/Rhythm guitarist had this to say :</p>
			<hr>
			<p> "As simple as it may sound there's not much to the band, it's kind of not trying to be anything in
				particular, it's almost a homage to our favourite bands and something that we hope they'd like; I've
				tried to incorporate elements of everything I like from their music"
				<br>
				<br> "It's like 'Hi Sentenced I made these songs for you, I hope you like it"
				<br>
				<br> "As much as it's a band and everyone's had their influence I've written essentially all the raw instrumental side of it; it's quite a personal thing in that way which everyone has perceived in their own way and it's become its own thing"
                        </p>
